In fact , this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable .

the two waitress 's looked like they had been sucking on lemons .

We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts ... .

Entrees include classics like lasagna , fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana .

I never had an orange donut before so I gave it a shot .

Stay with the roasted chickens and you 'll be fine .

The steak melted in my mouth .

i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about .

Anywhere else , the prices would be 3x as high !

I know real Indian food and this was n't it .

Desserts include flan and sopaipillas .

Beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth .

The decor is designed in a contemporary Japanese style restaurant .

Frankly , the chinese food here is something I can make better at home .

There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs .

We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate .

The owner and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable .

For the price you pay for the food here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants .

Could have had better for 1/3 the price in Chinatown .

It 's about $ 7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in .

I had roast chicken and a salad .

It 's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger .

because the waiters need SEVERE ATTITUE ADJUSTMENTS .

When it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time , walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted ... excuse me but is n't that his job ? ? ?

Dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters .

My friends and I stop here for pizza before hitting the Kips Bay movie theater .

I usually get one the Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup .

Unfortunately , we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport .

We did n't know if we should order a drink or leave ?

I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch .

Everytime I go there I ca n't pick anything to eat and not because the menu is filled with great things to eat .

Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and beans for $ 6.25 .

Chef Waldy 's always measures up .

Go for the Seafood Paella for two .

their brunch menu had something for everyone .

I 've come here for casual lunches as well as for a friend 's birthday and I always enjoy myself .

How can hope to stay in business with service like this ?

Best things to order are from the grill ( Churrasco and Ribs ) .

Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .

last Tuesday for a late lunch with a friend .

Another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese .

Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food , and there was no one to recommend any wine .

The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad ( including asking for salad dressing ) and was instead given a quesedilla .

I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes

When she complained , the waitress said , Sorry .

They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices .

From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate , the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care .

There 's candlelight and music .

I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got Garlic Shrimp .

THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS .

Ask for the round corner table next to the large window .

Did n't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food .

I can understand the prices if it served better food , like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area .

Have a mojito and sit in the back patio .

The waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch ! ! ! ! !

So we sat at the bar , the bartender did n't seem like he wanted to be there .

Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?

In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that 's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch .

then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people .

but for the value , it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group .

We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .

It was good , but none of the flavors WOW .

the restaurant was completely empty , but she gave me a dirty look and asked , no reservations ?

Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - does n't meet the bill .

And the food , well the food will keep you coming back .

Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well .

15 % gratuity automatically added to the bill .

Was her Monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel .

Dug the blue bar area too .

I got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago , I was in your upstrairs dining area .

I had to flag down a third staff person for a fork ... so now it 's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company .

The decor is what initially got me in the door .

Save room for the desserts ! ; - )

I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL ( OR BAD SERVICE ) @ PIGALLE .

Between my guest and I , we sampled at least 80 % of the menu , and they were all hits .

For someone who used to hate Indian food , Baluchi 's has changed my mid .

I went for restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu

They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak ( I tried them ALL ) .

After I paid for my purchase , I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie .

Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe 's may not be your favorite .

Build a meal with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .

I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu .

The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone , but they were out of it that day .

It does n't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it 's a whole other atmosphere .

We requested they re-slice the sushi , and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes .

Unfortunately , with our show tickets , we did n't have time to sample any desserts .

Make more tables - perhaps a rooftop bar ?

The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo , actually the street is part of that adventure .

I did n't go there for food so I ca n't comment .

Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .

Bring your date and a bottle of wine !

Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best ( I hope Mom does n't read this ! ) .

It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses .

Who said go when the place is quiet during the day ?

We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .

If you are here as a pre-show meal , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .

Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money .

After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .

The atmosphere takes you to that place , the place many dream of .

If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things .

`` The menu includes pub fare -- burgers , steaks and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as `` vegetarians .

I 'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu !

I just had my first visit to this place and ca n't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu .

I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk .

I have never in my life sent back food before , but I simply had to , and the waiter argued with me over this .

Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the food .

I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings .

Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great .

WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON .

WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE .

have always had a great time here .

You will be very happy with the experience .

I absolutely suggest this place .

Overall , this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been .

We love it , and took buses and cabs to get there .

If you ' re in New York , you do not want to miss this place .

I 've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never , ever dissapointed me .

My husband and I moved to Nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here , Peasant has been our favorite !

The whole experience was satisfying .

However , it was worth the visit .

Would not return for the amount we paid .

Stay away if you 're claustrophobic

If you 're in the 'hood , definitely stop in .

On the recommendation of a friend , I checked out Arezzo with my wife .

This is definitely one of the places that I have continued to come back to over the years .

I was n't impressed and it was n't SPICEY ? ? ? ?

I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway .

this restaurant is absolutely beautiful .

They were dry , stale and pretty flavorless .

I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked .

From the moment you walk in , you feel like you 're in the perfect place .

I find that most Kosher restaurants are average to good , but this has been the best I 've eaten so far .

Not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002 .

It was delicious and large !

As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .

An excellent choice in midtown .

My boyfriend and I went here last night and LOVED it !

My friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend .

The only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .

Everything about this place was wonderful .

Curioni 's Pizza has been around since the 1920 's .

I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year .

You wo n't be dissapointed .

Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district- far better than any restaurant in the area .

I ca n't stand this dungeon .

Delish and made to your liking !

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST !

since the first time I came here I 've been hooked .

People in the neighborhood seem to love it , too .

in conclusion , THIS PLACE SUCKS ! ! !

Nick Stef 's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area , so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald 's Square check it out !

Have to tell you : Not at all impressed .

How have I never been to Agave before ?

You 're going to drop some coin , but completely worth it , especially if you are looking to impress someone .

My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES .

A nice find in the neighborhood .

And as SOON as one person is done , she asked to pick up the plate immediately .

This place is Italian , not French .

After so many great reviews here , my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite .

There was a heat problem to boot , so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats !

My girlfriend and I just spent our 10 month anniversary at Lou Lou .

Bay Terrace mall is nothing ( ok , almost nothing ) without it !

My husband and I had a blast .

personally i say save your money .

Believe me , they live up to the name .

They are by far the BEST past in New York .

I have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance .

Everything is very cheap .

You 'll see a lot of people eating there after church .

I 've been a regular customer at Juice Generation for the last 3 months - my office moved to the Film Center on Ninth Avenue and they are on the next block .

It 's the kind of place I like to support !

just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications .

Would not recommend anyone to go .

We loved it and will go back !

I came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience .

We 'll definitly be back again !

This is the best Italian restaurant in the city .

There are numerous shavue restaurants in LA , but few out here .

Horrible experience - stay away !

If this restaurant was in Manhattan , I would definitely go more often .

One of my Fav spots in the city .

Over priced , overrated ... .stay away !

Do not go to this restaurant .

since i was in the neighborhood , we made sure to give this a try .

All I can say is they are fantastic .

I ca n't imagine how much worse it would have been if we 'd gone at a prime time !

I have dined at Mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter .

Definitely something to come down and check out .

I went for restaurant week .

I went there with a few friends and will return .

This place has been around for a few years .

I highly recommend this restaurant ! !

You will find everything about Trio to your liking !

This place was the worst .

I ordered from here last week .

This is a nice sushi restaurant in Brooklyn that 's located on 86 street , right underneath the train station .

I decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines .

Having moved I truly miss this place .

SUM IT : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .

I started going to dosa hut more after that .

Too bad , has a lot of potential .

Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves .

My first experience at Siam Square was very pleasant .

I have gone back to Siam Square many times since and everytime I am very satisfied overall .

We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful .

My personal favorite is Nick and Joe 's .

Another great thing about Glechik-everything is very cheap !

I would definitely come back to this restaurant .

The place just is n't ready for prime time .

Quartino is my favoriate resturant in NYC .

My order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes ( at the most ) of hanging up the phone .

And you never get the feeling that you need to leave .

great neighbhorhood spot .

Bobb V 's is a great place to take your Friends and Family !

Here 's the thing , you 're in the best city in the world for restaurants .

Go spend your money somewhere that really wows you .

The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .

This is a real gem of a place .

I think this a a wonderful place .

This place does n't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does , but it should .

Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter does n't mean we should be automatically impressed .

Like I said , Nick and Joe 's may not be everyone 's favorite , but it 's mine .

The help was extremely nice and did not rush us .

DO N'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE .

It 's cute and simple and I loved it .

My fiance and I recently wanted to see the city and deceided to take a dinner cruise .

Even after a few bad evenings at Bardolino , I keep coming back .

There are many french bistros in the midtown area , and I wholheartedly recommend this one .

This diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train .

Being a vegan myself , I 've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan -- and Zen Palate is easily my favorite .

Don Pedro 's is one of my favorite restaurants .

Cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre Italian restaurants .

Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective .

Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date .

You will not be missing anything .

I discovered Applebees when I went away to college in VA .

I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square , which is a shame since I do n't love this area .

This place is average ... at best .

Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be .

After reading the great reviews , I invited a die-hard downtown friend of mine to join me at TASTE .

Feels like family when we go there .

What a pleasant surprise !

It 's no-fuss , fast and delicious .

It was delish and I did n't feel bad eating it .

No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination .

i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too .

I 'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away ... been going there on and off for a year now and it 's really my fave hang out in the city .

It first came well done , and I politely sent it back .

Do n't waste your time or your money .

it 's good but , like the movie is never as good as the book , this is same analogy .

it was a very warm experience .

I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it 's not a cheap night out ... but it 's SO worth it .

expectations were real hi reading the '10 's ' .

It 's nice to find a place that is open 24 hours ( especially in downtown Brooklyn ) .

We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened .

I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it .

Both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar restaurant .

If you 're lucky and there 's not a private party going on back there , you 'll get a chance to really chill out .

They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip .

Actually , everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed .

You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here .

We 'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night .

SUM IT : do n't read the '10 's ' reviews , try it to judge for yourself so you wo n't have as hi expectations , then you 'll be sure to enjoy it .

We went there , no one greeted us .

We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left .

I have been in NYC for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the Hudson .

We were there March 7 and found Maison very nice .

went there last night with my coworker .

Alias is warm and cozy and you do n't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton .

This is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business !

I would not recommend MEET at all , it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in !

Went there for a special celebration .

The restaurant was quiet and intimate .

OK , I 've been to Dumont a few times now .

Maybe it 's that most of Dumont 's patrons are younger and have lower expectations , but I can not recommend Dumont .

I 've been to Sotto Voce several time , and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !

This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York .

It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again ! !

I read about this place in Time Out magazine .

It 's a great find in Astoria .

Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .

It 's always quiet because it 's awful .

I have to say the place was awesome .

The restaurant could use a little paint , but all in all a great sushi place !

My friends and I go once a week ( minimum , we live in the area ) and everytime ca n't resist walking out ready to burst .

Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to , but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine .

Do n't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review .

A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there .

It 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .

Before the place did n't call my attention .

But now that it 's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great .

Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here .

I do n't remember what we had ; nothing was memorable .

It is bland and nothing extrodinary .

Every time I visit NYC , I come here .

I 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .

We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to .

Weekends can get crowded , but still highly recommended .

It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early .

I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat .
