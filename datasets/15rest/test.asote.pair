The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it .

The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting , without it trying to be that .

not only is the food

There is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week .

Place is open till late , no dress code .

Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top ? ?

I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .

Not because you are `` The Four Seasons '' ... – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .

I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $ 400.00 where I am not swept off my feet .

Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll .

I ca n't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York .

My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor .

Do n't get me started on the margaritas , either .

We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $ 8 a piece .

Food was OK .

Oh , and there 's hookah .

Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ' that ' couple .

Thank you everyone at Water 's Edge .

The high prices you 're going to pay is for the view not for the food .

We thought the dessert would be better , Wrong !

When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .

So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .

Sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .

This is the first place I 've been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .

Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .

this place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all .

Maggot in the food !

Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .

I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .

The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .

I got hair in my food 2 times of then !

Rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .

This place survives on reputation alone .

I came across Village Underground by accident , now I go there all the time .

But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include Wine ?

What you are paying for is the environment and the name .

The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` I 've been to the four seasons restaurant '' .

I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience !

We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .

We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .

After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .

I would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .

I believe there were 2 shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp '' appetizer .

I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .

Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .

But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food

Bukhara Grill , the tagline says it all.. `` INDIAN SPICE RAVE ''

My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean .

It ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !

The entrees were served with miso soup and rice .

I don ’ t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I ’ ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

But for the Shabu Shabu , you wo n't find much better in NY .

Restaurant with a view

This place does n't make any sense

Regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .

How is this palce still open ?

At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .

If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .

This place ... god where do i begin .

How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .

Though it 's been crowded most times I 've gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .

Only complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .

Maitre-D - " Eat and get out "

A word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-D 's sense of `` table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else .

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level

At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .

Don ’ t go to this place !

There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .

Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .

I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .

I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , `` can I help you '' and `` how many are in your party . ''

I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .

The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .

The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .

I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .
