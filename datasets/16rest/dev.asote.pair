I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .

Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ' that ' couple .

the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .

Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .

You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .

So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .

I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .

The lox is always fresh too .
[(1, 1), (4, 4), 'POS']
I will go back to Suan soon !

When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .

The wine list is also really nice .

You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .
